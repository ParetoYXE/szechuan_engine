# szechuan_engine

The most based game engine ever. 

Period

Bar none


The Goal of this engine will be to recreate the old school PC RPG systems first implemented by Richard Garient in his Ultima series. 

Features will involve the implementation of an overworld map, interior locations for towns/buildings/dungeons, randomized NPC encounters and loot, live combat rather then turned based and the modern faction and political systems not possible in the early RPG genre.
